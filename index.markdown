# Software Engineer & Full Stack Developer

Graduating University in July 2020 as a student of Computing and Games Development at The University of Plymouth with First Class Honors.

I first delved into the world of software development and programming at the age of 16 through a DOS terminal emulator, playing around with sorting algorithms and text-based RPGs in BASIC. After this, I quickly moved on to VB and created my first game - an 8-bit Snake clone. üêç

In more recent years my degree allowed me to steer away from video games, and after a year's industrial placement with HM Land Registry, I discovered a new interest in emerging web technologies. I began working on end-to-end, full-stack, software solutions that encompassed the automation of grand corporate tasks such as The Digitalisation of Mortgage Applications and the Modernisation of Lottery Grant Aquisitions. Overall, this experience was invaluable and exposed me to the real-world possibilities and approaches applied within Software Development.
