# Software Engineers & Full Stack Developer

Graduating University in July 2020 as a student of Computing and Games Development at the University of Plymouth.

I first delved into the world of software development and programming at the age of 16 through a DOS terminal emulator, playing around with sorting algorithms and text-based RPGs in BASIC. After this, I quickly moved on to VB and created my first game - an 8-bit Snake clone. üêç

In more recent years my course has allowed me to steer away from video games and after a year's industrial placement with HM Land Registry, I discovered a new interest in emerging web technologies. I began working on end-to-end, full-stack, software solutions that encompassed the automation of grand corporate tasks such as The Digitalisation of Mortgage Applications. Overall, this experience was invaluable and exposed me to the real-world possibilities and approaches applied within software-development.
