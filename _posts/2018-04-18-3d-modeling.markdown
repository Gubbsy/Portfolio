During my second year at university, I had my first taste of designing, texturing and implementing 3D models within a Unity scene. The experience was a welcomed change from the heavy programming modules that were running in tangent with this project and during this time I created several experiences to experiment with modelling techniques and scene interaction and lighting.  

# Skills Developed
