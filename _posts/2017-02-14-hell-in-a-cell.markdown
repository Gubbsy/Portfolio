Hell in a Cell was the first Unity game I ever created. Inspired by classic gun runner games such as Doom, this top-down shooter is fast-paced and action intensive. I created all the models, animations and lighting models myself with the sprite tool magic voxel. The development introduced me to Object Orientated game design and gave me an insight into software development within a game's context.
