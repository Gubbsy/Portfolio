Habitat is a mobile application that was born out of collective experiences of living in shared rental accommodation. It looks to solve issues surrounding property management and maintenance - providing a single platform for information and communications between landlords and tenants. 

The application was developed as a team amongst 3 University colleagues, where I assumed the role of Project Lead and Frontend Developer. 

# Skills Developed
* Constructing a native mobile technology stack.
* Designing and implementing an abstract API layer for Frontend/Server communications.
* Managing, Analysing, Iterating and Delegating development task within a small agile scrum team. (Using Trello and Planaway) 
* Utilising dependency injections to provide manageable, testable and reusable frontend services. 

# Overall Outcomes
This project provided me with the opportunity to collaborate and develop a technology stack that builds to native mobile devices. The frontend of the application was constructed using Angular 8 and Ionic Cordova - allowing cross-platform building with access to OS-specific functionality. The backend was written using ASP.NetCore and made use of Entity Framework to craft a NoSQL database layer for a rapid development environment. 

Assuming the role of Project Lead was quite daunting a first, however, I quickly found my feet amongst the team and through daily stand-up meetings, weekly retrospectives and hands-on task delegation, as a team, we were able to deliver a working prototype in a short span of only 12 weeks. 
Under the role of Project Lead, I was also responsible to extracting user-stories from potential user interviews and broke each user story down into development task for us to complete - using tools such as Trello and Github Cards to organise and manage tasks.
