This project was my first experience with an unmanaged language such as C++. I created a consol driven application that could dynamically read and render both `.obj` and `.dae` files while also providing the ability to dynamically swap the vertex and fragment shaders applied to the rendered model.

# Skills Developed
* Application of an unmanaged language - C++.
* OpenGL shader development.
* Application of OpenGL and graphics libraries to render 3D models.
* Algorithm development and refinement for faster file parsing with large data sets. 

# Overall Outcomes
As previously mentioned this project was my first dive into C++ and didn't come without its challenges. Working with an unmanaged language for the first time created a steep learning curve that was only multiplied by the complexities of OpenGL. However, with time I gained an appreciation for the control and possibilities allowed by an unmanaged language, especially with regards to memory management.
