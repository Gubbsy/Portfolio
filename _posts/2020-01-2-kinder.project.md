Kinder was a fun little project I created during university where users could visit a site that presents them with cat images they can rate using emojis. Each vote they cast adds to cat's overall cuteness rating, with a live-updated feed of the Top 5 cats presented at the bottom of the page. The frontend of the application s built using the Angular 8 framework, while the backend is constructed using express with using an MVC repository pattern with a supporting MongoDB DB layer. 

# Skills Developed
* Independent Full-stack architecture design.
* Use of WebSockets, Cookies and JSON web-tokens.
* Web API development using Express.
* Use of MongoDB in a document repository context. 
* Applying a Test Driven Development (TDD) Strategy and leveraging Dependency Injection for code testability. 
* Implementing a CI pipeline, ensuring high-quality code. 

# Overall Outcomes
This project helped to clarify some core concepts within Web API development and apply industry-standard technologies (WebSockets/Cookies/JSON web-tokens) I was yet to experience. The project also forced a necessity to consider the wider architecture of the applications and consider service interactions on a greater scale, I eventually settled on an MVC Repository pattern as it decoupled business logic within the business logic from the database access layer. 

This was also my first project were I applied TDD approach to which I saw great benefit. From the get-go to consider how my application would be constructed and designed and consider how I would ensure each element of my code was testable. I implemented an Azure CI pipeline to build and produce test reports, certifying my application could build and run outside of my development environment.
